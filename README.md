# WealthSimulation
A simulation of wealth random transformation in society

Everyone has 1 wealth initially.

Every turn, one person randomly gives 1 wealth to another, include self.

## So we will see when the result is being sorted:
![Snapshot1](https://github.com/zhazhaniu/WealthSimulation/raw/master/screenshots/1.png "Snapshot1")
then someone has conclusion that the rich will be richer, the poor will be poorer.

## Lets change another random method, such as LFSR:
![Snapshot2](https://github.com/zhazhaniu/WealthSimulation/raw/master/screenshots/2.png "Snapshot2")
Seems the same result, out of our imagine.

## But when we use another sort method:
![Snapshot3](https://github.com/zhazhaniu/WealthSimulation/raw/master/screenshots/3.png "Snapshot3")
Normal Distribution appears.

JUST FOR FUN!!!
